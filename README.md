# RTPodcastArchiver
Tool to archive Rooster Teeth FIRST podcasts.

These podcasts are property of Rooster Teeth Productions. These archives are to keep the good work of many individuals alive as Rooster Teeth shuts down.

This does not archive podcasts hosted on Rooster Teeth site itself, and these are the audio only podcasts.

This tool is separated into two parts.
- `src/Downloader/` - For downloading podcasts to your local machine.
- `src/Uploader/` - For archiving podcasts you previously downloaded to the internet archive.

# Using these archives in podcasts apps
As each of these podcasts get updated there will also be an rss feed you can subscribed to them at. That will be in the notes section of the archives above.

In general it is a url like this,
> https://archive.org/download/rt-podcast-30-morbid-minutes/podcast.rss
If you copy that and paste it into our podcast/RSS app of choice you should be able to continue to listen to podcasts over time.

# Downloading these archives
Internet Archive provides a way to download these archives. Once they are at 100% uploaded it is recommended you download what you want and copy it to a DVD for safe keeping.
